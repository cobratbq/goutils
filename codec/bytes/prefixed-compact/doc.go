// ## Specification: "prefixed-compact"
//
// A very basic encoding that allows for encoding values in a limited structure. The protocol essentially
// offers "byte-carriers", either in singular form or (multiple) in sequence. Values are either plain (a
// number of bytes) or key-value-pair. Given its streamable nature, one may assume that order of occurrence is
// meaningful, e.g. earlier occurrence indicating higher priority or later occurrence superseding earlier
// occurrence, as needed.
//
// Note: although at first glance a key-value-pair wouldn't make much sense, it does allow encoding predefined
// keys, such that multiple versions of a protocol can identify which specific "labeled" value they receive as
// opposed to relying solely on (assumed) positional values. Furthermore, unknown labels may be ignored or
// alternatively may indicate unsupported format or unknown elements.
//
// 4 Flags are provided to indicate:
//
// - termination: whether the value terminates now, or a follow-up record is expected carrying the remainder,
// - value-type: a plain value or key-value-pair ("labeled" value),
// - multiplicity: a single value or multiple (collection of) values,
// - header-size: a 1-byte header, indicating sizes `[0, 15]`, or 2-byte header, indicating sizes `[1, 4096]`,
//
// The `termination`-bit is used to indicate whether this value is completed, meaning that if the bit is set,
// this entry concludes a value (possibly in a single entry), while an unset bit indicates that the following
// entry will continue the present value, effectively as concatenated bytes.
// Note: the non-terminated value _must_ be continued with the same type.
//
// This encoding does not provide any redundancy, error-correction or "value-type finished"-indicators.
// Consequently, corruption of the header-bytes will result in misinterpretation of subsequent data. (This
// must be solved outside of the encoding, if there is risk of corruption.)
//
// ## Interpretation of values (bytes) is left to be determined by the reader (application).
//
// This includes the exact meaning of the data-types. For example, duplicate keys in a map may indicate an
// error, or a replacement value, or an addition of a second value to the key, or an concatenation onto the
// first value, or ...
//
// There is inherent order through the position in the data-stream, consequently a sequence (which itself
// defines the size, i.e. number of elements) has an order, which may be ignored (collection), or could
// indicate priority (list), or age i.e. history of prior values, ...
//
// The termination-bit which is used to indicate the end of a value, could be used to partition data in
// smaller chunks, either to benefit limited processing capabilities of embedded devices, or to transfer data
// as it is incoming at irregular intervals, or to signal an artificial boundary as a new batch refreshes/
// updates the data from the previous batch, or for streams of data for which the number of entries is not yet
// known. (One could signal the end of the value-type with a 0-size terminated entry, if needed.)
//
// In terms of interpreting values into data-types: this encoding does not provide any support towards that
// goal. 8-byte values _could_ indicate a big-endian/little-endian signed/unsigned 64-bit integer value. This
// would need to be aligned between communicating parties, either by convention or by agreement.
// "Labeled" values could be used to indicate a format. However, e.g. inter-process communication may not be
// concerned with these kinds of issues if it is all built from the same basic functions/libraries.
//
// TODO when stream-data is manipulated, all bets are off. E.g. if size-bits are tweaked, subsequent data is wrongly interpreted, so you might take on too much data and you might subsequently misinterpret data as header. (Do we care at this abstraction?)
// TODO document, make explicit that size-bits are encoded in big-endian, such that MSB from first byte are available to use as flags.
// TODO consider making shortest possible header mandatory, i.e. any size/count of <= 15, must use 1-byte header, that way the initial overlap of 2-byte header could be used to signal other characteristics in the future(?)
// TODO if shortest-possible header is mandatory, the first few values for 2-byte header could be used to signal a (custom) extension of the encoding and/or format that unsupporting readers would process as invalid. (Alternatively, it would be more flexible to process any valid value.)
// TODO decide on explicit null-value (would need to be indicated in the redundant space of a 2-byte header) or to leave implicit, i.e. 0-size bytes, absence of key-entry in map, etc.

// FLAG_TERMINATIONBIT indicates whether this completes the current value. Usually set, unless large
// values/keys/lists/maps are represented. If unset, indicates that the next entry is a continuation of this
// entry, effectively a concatenation of the next value-bytes onto the current value-bytes. The
// continuation-value must have the same bits for value-type and multiplicity as the initial value, otherwise
// the continuation is illegal.
//
// The termination-bit may be set or unset for any size/count. This makes it possible to reconstruct values
// from parts of varying lengths, possibly benefiting small devices or variable/unpredictable input-streams.
// TODO there was originally an idea to make a zero-size without termination-bit a special case for a list/map of unspecified length. However, this requires some form of termination to indicate the end, and that is currently not yet decided on.
// TODO document: if not set, must be followed by entry of same type-flags optionally FLAG_TERMINATION set, of any (allowed) size.
// FIXME use "termination"-flag or the reverse?

// Note that we don't actually support type-information for values. We merely specify "containers"
// ("byte-carriers") of a certain size.
// The key-value pair is redundant in the sense that it could be expressed as 2 plain values in sequence,
// however that is based on convention. By allowing singular key-value-pair as type, we can express
// syntactically a key with its corresponding value. This, in turn, can function as version-independent
// indicator for whatever encoded format is represented. Thus giving any expressed format _some_ syntactically
// enforced handles for recognizing/interpreting an encoded payload.
