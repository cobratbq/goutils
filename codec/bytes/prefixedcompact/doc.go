// Specification: "prefixed-compact" (temporary name)
//
// A very basic protocol and encoding that allows for encoding values in a limited structure. The protocol
// essentially offers "byte-carriers", either in singular form or (multiple) in sequence. Values are either
// plain (a number of bytes) or key-value-pair.
// Given its streamable nature, one may assume that order of occurrence is meaningful, e.g. earlier occurrence
// indicating higher priority or later occurrence superseding earlier occurrence, as needed.
//
// Note: although at first glance a key-value-pair wouldn't make much sense, it does allow specifying
// predefined keys, such that multiple versions of a protocol can identify which specific "labeled" value they
// receive as opposed to relying solely on (assumed) positional values. Furthermore, unknown labels may be
// ignored or alternative may indicate unsupported or unknown elements.
//
// 4 Flags are provided to indicate:
//
// - termination: whether the value terminates now, or a follow-up record is expected carrying the remainder,
// - value-type: a plain value or key-value-pair ("labeled" value),
// - multiplicity: a single value or multiple (sequence of) values,
// - header-size: a 1-byte header, indicating sizes `[0, 15]`, or 2-byte header, indicating sizes `[1, 4096]`,
//
// The `termination`-bit is used to indicate whether this value is completed, meaning that if the bit is set,
// this entry concludes a value (possibly in a single entry), while an unset bit indicates that the following
// entry will continue the present value, effectively as concatenated bytes.
// Note: the continuation must be of the same type.
//
// Interpretation of values (bytes) is left to be determined by the reader (application).
// TODO decide on a name once proven to be effective.
// TODO In-development, changes are likely...
// TODO document, make explicit that size-bits are encoded in big-endian, such that MSB from first byte are available to use as flags.
// TODO consider making shortest possible header mandatory, i.e. any size/count of <= 15, must use 1-byte header, that way the initial overlap of 2-byte header could be used to signal other characteristics in the future(?)

// FLAG_TERMINATIONBIT indicates whether this completes the current value. Usually set, unless large
// values/keys/lists/maps are represented. If unset, indicates that the next entry is a continuation of this
// entry, effectively a concatenation of the next value-bytes onto the current value-bytes. The
// continuation-value must have the same bits for value-type and multiplicity as the initial value, otherwise
// the continuation is illegal.
//
// The termination-bit may be set or unset for any size/count. This makes it possible to reconstruct values
// from parts of varying lengths, possibly benefiting small devices or variable/unpredictable input-streams.
// TODO there was originally an idea to make a zero-size without termination-bit a special case for a list/map of unspecified length. However, this requires some form of termination to indicate the end, and that is currently not yet decided on.
// TODO document: if not set, must be followed by entry of same type-flags optionally FLAG_TERMINATION set, of any (allowed) size.

// FLAG_KEYVALUE indicates whether this concerns just a value or a key-value-pair. In case of the key-value-
// pair, `size` indicates the size of the key.
// unset: plain value, set: key-value-pair.
// Note that we don't actually support type-information for values. We merely specify "containers"
// ("byte-carriers") of a certain size.
// The key-value pair is redundant in the sense that it could be expressed as 2 plain values in sequence,
// however that is based on convention. By allowing singular key-value-pair as type, we can express
// syntactically a key with its corresponding value. This, in turn, can function as version-independent
// indicator for whatever encoded format is represented. Thus giving any expressed format _some_ syntactically
// enforced handles for recognizing/interpreting an encoded payload.
// TODO document: FLAG_KEYVALUE indicates the key, must be followed by a value of any type, i.e. the key cannot be the last entry.
