# GoUtils

Common utilities for Go.

The GoUtils module provides common operations that typically operate on a single type or within a single package. These are all simple sequences of logical operations that are context-independent and can therefore be captured in an independent module.

Utilities are packaged per representative package, for example `std/crypto/rand` for utilities operating on the `crypto/rand` package in the Go standard library.
